#  Cashfree Node.Js AutoCollect Integration 

Python bindings for interacting with the Cashfree API for AutoCollect. This is useful for merchants who are looking to automatically reconcile their incoming bank transfers.

# Using 

As you can see there are two files. "Execute.js" is a guide to calling the API. <br />
NOTE : Ensure that "execute.js" and "cfAutoCollect.js" are in the same folder.

# Setting Up

You will need to authenticate client by calling the client_auth function as follows : 

```node.js
from cfAutoCollect import cfAutoCollect

userExample = cfAutoCollect("dummyClientId", "dummyClientSecret", "TEST/PROD")
userExample.client_auth()

```

# Functionality

You can perform the following functions : 

**Create Virtual Account**
```
userExample.create_virtual_account("TEST","Tester", "9999999999", "tester@gmail.com");
```

**View Recent Payments according to Virtual Account ID**
```
userExample.recent_payments("TEST");
```
**List all Virtual Accounts**

```
userExample.list_all_va();
```
**Verify Signature**

```
userExample.is_valid_signature(data)
```
